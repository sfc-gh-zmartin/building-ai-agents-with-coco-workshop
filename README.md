## What You'll Build

**GitTrend** — a working Cortex AI agent that answers natural language questions about trending GitHub repositories, powered by 107M+ real GitHub events (30 days of public GitHub activity).

Ask it things like:
- *"What's the fastest-growing AI project in the last 30 days?"*
- *"What languages dominate trending repos right now?"*
- *"Is there anything trending around agentic AI or MCP this month?"*

CoCo writes every SQL statement. You direct it. You own the result.

## What to Bring

**Just your laptop and a willingness to build.**

We handle everything in the session — account signup, data load, and agent creation all happen live together. No prep needed.

If you want a head start: sign up for a free Snowflake trial using the event link below **before arriving** and run the setup SQL in Step 0 of the Workshop Guide. It loads ~107M GitHub events (~4 min) and means you'll be building from minute one.

**[Event trial signup](https://signup.snowflake.com/?t=521d04bacb9556ae0a2fcb837fbf1db2e78f9e0581a062acb9c7e4100ac1eba6)** — choose **AWS US East (Ohio)**, select **AI Data Cloud**. Do not select AWS US East (N. Virginia).

## Workshop Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`WORKSHOP-GUIDE.md`](WORKSHOP-GUIDE.md) | Step-by-step guide — follow this during the session |
| [`CHECKPOINTS.sql`](CHECKPOINTS.sql) | Fallback SQL for each step — use if CoCo gets stuck |
| [`workshop-materials/`](workshop-materials/) | Slides and additional post-event resources |

## The 5-Step Pattern

![Workshop teaser — intro to payoff](workshop-teaser.gif)

```
1. Load the data         →  107M GitHub events via COPY INTO from public S3
2. CoCo explores         →  Describe the schema, find the right columns
3. Build the query       →  Trending AI repos by star activity, last 30 days
4. Add CORTEX.COMPLETE   →  Turn SQL results into natural language
5. Wire the agent        →  Cortex Search + Cortex Agent = GitTrend
```

Same pattern works on any dataset in your organization.
